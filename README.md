This smart contract used for the customer to register themselves, which can be verified later by authority it can be banks or contract creator.
1. In contract user name, contact number, address are stored while registration.
2. After customer registration is done the details resided in the contract for further validation where they get verified by authority or banks.
3. After the verification stage is done, banks or authority can easily get customer details base on customer address or customer order number in which they register themselves.
4. Only authority can add banks where they validated automatically for collision with existing ones.

In every stage of contract validation and verification done automatically and if any verification or validation gets fails contract state reverted to the previous state.
